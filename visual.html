    </div>

    <div class="container">
        <p style="text-align: right; padding-right: 100px;"> CSS declarations are structured into property
            and
            value
            pairs:<br>
            <br>- The <em>font-family</em> property defines the typeface of an element
            <br>- <em>font-size</em> controls the size of text displayed
            <br>- <em>font-weight</em> defines how thin or thick text is displayed
            <br>- The <em>text-align</em> property places text in the left, right,
            or center of its parent container
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 100px;">Text can have two different
            color
            attributes,
            <em>color</em> and <em>background-color</em>:
            <br>- <em>color</em> defines the color of the text,
            while <em>background-color</em> defines the color behind the text
            <br>CSS can make an element transparent with the <em>opacity</em> property
            <br> CSS can also set the background of an element to an image with the
            <em>background-image</em>
            property
            <br>The <em>!important</em> flag will override any style,
            <br>however it should almost never be used, <br>as it is extremely difficult to override<br>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="space"><br>
        <h1 id="imp" style="text-align: center;">!Important</h1>
        <br>
        <p> <em>!important</em> can be applied to specific attributes instead of full
            rules. It will override any style no matter
            how specific it is. As a result, it should almost never be used. Once !important is used, it is very
            hard to override.
            Since !important is used on the p selector’s color attribute, all p elements will appear blue, even
            though there is a more specific .main p selector that sets the color attribute to red.</p>

    </div>

    <div id="flow" class="caption"><br>
        <h1>Flow of HTML</h1>
        <p>A browser will render the elements of an HTML document that has no CSS from left to right, top to
            bottom, in the same order as they exist in the document. This is called the flow of elements in
            HTML.

            In addition to the properties that it provides to style HTML elements, CSS includes properties that
            change how a browser positions elements. These properties specify where an element is located on a
            page, if the element can share lines with other elements, and other related attributes.

            In this lesson, you will learn five properties for adjusting the position of HTML elements in the
            browser:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>position</li>
            <li>z-index</li>
            <li>display</li>
            <li>float</li>
            <li>clear</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Each of these properties will allow us to position and view elements on a web page. They can be used
            in conjunction with any other styling properties you may know.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="position" class="position"><br>
        <h1>Position</h1>
        <p>Block-level elements like boxes create a block the full width of their parent elements, and they
            prevent other elements from appearing in the same horizontal space.<br>
            Notice the block-level elements take up their own line of space and therefore don’t
            overlap each other. In the browser you can see block-level elements also consistently appear on
            the left side of the browser. This is the default position for block-level elements.

            The default position of an element can be changed by setting its position property. The position
            property
            can take one of four values:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>static - the default value (it does not need to be specified)</em></li>
            <li><a href="#relative">relative</a></li>
            <li><a href="#absolute">absolute</a></li>
            <li><a href="#fixed">fixed</a></li>
            <p><img src="static.png"></p>
        </ul>

        <p>If you favor the default position of an HTML element, you don’t need to set its
            position property.
        </p><br>

        <h2 id="relative">Relative</h2>
        <p>This value allows you to position an element relative to its default static position on the web page.
            Although the code instructs the browser to expect a relative positioning of the div, it
            does not specify where the div should be positioned on the page. The
            div has been positioned using two (top, left) of the four offset properties. The valid offset properties
            are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>top - moves the element down</li>
            <li>bottom - moves the element up</li>
            <li>left - moves the element right</li>
            <li>right - moves the element left</li>
        </ul><br>
        <p><img src="relative.png"></p>
        <p>
            In the example above, the <em>div</em> will be moved down 20 pixels and to the right 50 pixels from its
            default static position. The image displays the new position of the box. The dotted line represents
            where the statically positioned (default) box was positioned.
            Units for offset properties can be specified in pixels, ems, or percentages. Note that offset properties
            will not work if the value of the element’s position property is the default static.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 id="absolute">Absolute</h2>
        <p>Another way of modifying the position of an element is by setting its position to absolute.

            When an element’s position is set to absolute all other elements on the page will ignore the element and act
            like it is not present on the page. The element will be positioned relative to its closest positioned parent
            element.
            In the example above, the .box-bottom
            div will be moved down and right from the top left corner of the view. If offset properties weren’t
            specified,
            the top box would be entirely covered by the bottom box. Take a look at the gif below:
        </p>
        <p><img src="absolute.gif"><br>
            The bottom box in this image (colored blue) is displaced from the top left corner of its container. It is 20
            pixels lower and 50 pixels to the right of the top box.

            In the next exercise, we will compare the scrolling of absolute elements with fixed elements.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 id="fixed">Fixed</h2>
        <p>
            When an element’s position is set to absolute, as in the last exercise, the element will scroll with the
            rest of the document when a user scrolls.

            We can fix an element to a specific position on the page (regardless of user scrolling) by setting its
            position to fixed.
            This technique is often used for navigation bars on a web page.<br>
        </p>
        <p><img src="fixed.gif">
        </p>
        <p>As an example:<br>
            1. In style.css, change the position inside of the header rule to fixed. Scroll up and down the web page.
            What
            do you notice?
            <br>
            2.
            Notice that part of the “Welcome” section is now covered up by the header. That’s because when we changed
            the position of the header to fixed, we removed it from the flow of the html document. Let’s fix that.
            Change the position of the .welcome element to relative.
            <br>
            3.
            Offset the “Welcome” section by 200 pixels from the top. Everything might not be displaying correctly just
            yet; we’ll fix it in a later exercise.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="index" class="index"><br>
        <h1>Z-index</h1>
        <p>
            When boxes on a web page have a combination of different positions, the boxes (and therefore, their content)
            can overlap with each other, making the content difficult to read or consume.
            The z-index property controls how far “back” or how far “forward” an element should appear on the web page
            when elements overlap. This can be thought of the depth of elements, with deeper elements appearing behind
            shallower elements.

            The z-index property accepts integer values. Depending on their values, the integers instruct the browser on
            the order in which elements should be displayed on the web page.
            In the example above, we set the .box-top position to relative and the z-index to 2. We changed position to
            relative, because the z-index property does not work on static elements. The z-index of 2 moves the .box-top
            element forward, because it is greater than the .box-bottom z-index, 1. See the example image below:<br>
            <img src="z-index.png"><br>
            In the image above, you can see the top box is moved in front of the bottom box.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="inline" class="inline"><br>
        <h1>Inline Display</h1>
        <p>Every HTML element has a default display value that dictates if it can share horizontal space with other
            elements. Some elements fill the entire browser from left to right regardless of the size of their content.
            Other elements only take up as much horizontal space as their content requires and can be directly next to
            other elements.

            In this lesson, we’ll cover three values for the display property: inline, block, and inline-block.
            The default display for some tags, such as <em>em</em>, <strong>strong</strong>, and
            <em><strong>a</strong></em> (link), is
            called
            inline.
        </p>
        <p>Inline elements have a
            box that wraps tightly around their content, only taking up the amount of space necessary to
            display their content and not requiring a new line after each element. The height and width of
            these elements cannot be specified in the CSS document. For example, the text of an anchor tag
            (<b>a</b>) will, by default, be displayed on the same line as the surrounding text, and it will only
            be as wide as necessary to contain its content. inline elements cannot be altered in size
            with the height or width CSS properties.</p>
        <p>
            The CSS display property provides the ability to make any element an inline element. This includes elements
            that are not inline by default such as paragraphs, divs, and headings.
        </p>
        <h1>Block Display</h1>
        <p>Some elements are not displayed in the same line as the content around them. These are called block-level
            elements. These elements fill the entire width of the page by default, but their width property can also be
            set. Unless otherwise specified, they are the height necessary to accommodate their content.

            Elements that are block-level by default include all levels of heading elements <em>(h1 through h6), p, div
                and footer. </em></p>
        <p>strong {
            display: block;
            }<br>
            In the example above, all strong elements will be displayed on their own line, with no content directly on
            either side of them even though their contents may not fill the width of most computer screens.
        </p>
        <h1>Inline-Block Display</h1>
        <p>
            The third value for the display property is inline-block. Inline-block display combines features of both
            inline and block elements. Inline-block elements can appear next to each other and we can specify their
            dimensions using the width and height properties. Images are the best example of default inline-block
            elements.

            For example,
            divs in the CSS below will be displayed on the same line and with the specified dimensions:
        </p><br>

        <div class="rectangle">
            <p>I’m a rectangle!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="rectangle">
            <p>So am I!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="rectangle">
            <p>Me three!</p>
        </div>
        <p>In the example above, there are three rectangular divs that each contain a paragraph of text. The .rectangle
            divs will all appear inline (provided there is enough space from left to right) with a width of 300 pixels
            and height of 200 pixels, even though the text inside of them may not require 300 pixels by 200 pixels of
            space.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="float" class="float">
        <h1>Float</h1>
        <p>So far, you’ve learned how to specify the exact position of an element using offset properties. If you’re
            simply interested in moving an element as far left or as far right as possible on the page, you can use the
            float property.

            The float property can be set to one of two values:

            left - this value will move, or float, elements as far left as possible.
            right - this value will move elements as far right as possible.<br></p>
        <p>
            <img class="imgfl" src="float-right.png">
        </p>
        <p>
            Floated elements must have a width specified, as in the example above. Otherwise, the element will assume
            the full width of its containing element, and changing the float value will not yield any visible results.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="clear" class="clear">
        <h1>Clear</h1>
        <p>The float property can also be used to float multiple elements at once. However, when multiple floated
            elements have different heights, it can affect their layout on the page. Specifically, elements can “bump”
            into each other and not allow other elements to properly move to the left or right.

            The clear property specifies how elements should behave when they bump into each other on the page. It can
            take on one of the following values:
        <ul>
            <li>left — the left side of the element will not touch any other element within the same containing element.
            </li>
            <li></li>right — the right side of the element will not touch any other element within the same containing
            element.</li>
            <li>both — neither side of the element will touch any other element within the same containing element.</li>
            <li>none — the element can touch either side.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="up">
        <a href="#top">TOP</a>
    </div>
