      <h2>The properties include:</h2>
      <p>
        <li>
          Width and height - specifies the width and height of the content area.
        </li>
        <li>
          Padding - specifies the amount of space between the content area and
          the border.

        <li>
          Border - specifies the thickness and style of the border surrounding

        </li>
        <li>
          Margin - specifies the amount of space between the border and the

    <div id="border" class="border">
      <h1>BORDER</h1>
      <h2>
        A border is a line that surrounds an element, like a frame around a
        painting. <br />
        Borders can be set with a specific width, style, and color.
      </h2>
      <p>
        <li>
          width — The thickness of the border. A border’s thickness can be set
          in pixels or with one of the following keywords: thin, medium, or
          thick.
        </li>
        <li>
          style — The design of the border. Web browsers can render any of 10
          different styles. Some of these styles include: none, dotted, and
          solid.
        </li>
        <li>
          color — The color of the border. Web browsers can render colors using
          a few different formats, including 140 built-in color keywords.
        </li>
        <li>
          The default border is medium none color, where color is the current
          color of the element. <br />
          If width,style, or color are not set in the CSS file, the web browser
          assigns the default value for that property.
        </li>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="radius" class="round">
      <h1>RADIUS</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>RADIUS</li>
        <li>RADIUS</li>
        <li>RADIUS</li>
        <li>RADIUS</li>
        <li>RADIUS</li>
        <li>RADIUS</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You can modify the corners of an element’s border box with the
        border-radius property.<br /><br />
        You can create a border that is a perfect circle by first creating an
        element with the same width and height and then setting the radius equal
        to the distance between the center of the circle and the width of the
        box, which is 50%.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="padding" class="inside">
      <h1>PADDING</h1>
      <h3>
        The padding property is often used to expand the background color and
        make content look less cramped.
      </h3>
      <p>
        If you want to be more specific about the amount of padding on each side
        of a box’s content, you can use the following properties:
        <br />padding-top <br />padding-right <br />padding-bottom
        <br />padding-left <br />Each property affects the padding on only one
        side of the box’s content, giving you more flexibility in customization.
      </p>
      <h3>PADDING - another implementations</h3>
      <p>
        the four values 6px 11px 4px 9px correspond to the amount of padding in
        a clockwise rotation. In order, it specifies the amount of padding on
        the top (6 pixels), right (11 pixels), bottom (4 pixels), and left (9
        pixels) sides of the content.
      </p>
      <p>
        When using this implementation of the padding property, we must specify
        a padding value for all four sides of the element. However, if the top
        and bottom values for padding will equal each other, and the left and
        right values for padding will also equal each other, you can use the
        shortcut: The first value, 5px, sets the padding value for the top and
        bottom sides of the content. The second value, 10px, sets the padding
        value for the left and right sides of the content.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="margin" class="margin">
      <h1>MARGIN: VALUES</h1>
      <h2>
        Margin refers to the space directly outside of the box. <br />The margin
        property is used to specify the size of this space.
      </h2>
      <p>
        One can use only one property "margin", which will specify all four
        sides of the margin. If you want to be even more specific about the
        amount of margin on each side of a box, you can use the following
        properties: <br />margin-top <br />margin-right <br />margin-bottom
        <br />margin-left <br />Each property affects the margin on only one
        side of the box, providing more flexibility in customization. It’s
        common to see margin values used only for a specific side of an element.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just like the padding shortcut, when you’re certain that the top and
        bottom values for margin will equal each other, and that the left and
        right values for margin will also equal each other, you can use the
        shortcut of two values.
      </p>
      <p>
        A similar implementation of the margin property is used to specify
        exactly how much margin there should be on each side of the box in a
        single declaration. Like in the padding of four different values.<br />
        The four values 6px 10px 5px 12px refer to the amount of margin around
        the box in a clockwise rotation. In order, it specifies the amount of
        margin on the top (6 pixels), right (10 pixels), bottom (5 pixels), and
        left (12 pixels) sides of the box.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="auto" class="collapse">
      <h1>MARGIN: AUTO and COLLAPSE</h1>
      <h2>AUTO</h2>
      <p>
        In the example above, margin: 0 auto; will center the divs in their
        containing elements. The 0 sets the top and bottom margins to 0 pixels.
        The auto value instructs the browser to adjust the left and right
        margins until the element is centered within its containing element.<br />
        in the example above should center within an element that fills the
        page, but this doesn’t occur. Why?<br />
        In order to center an element, a width must be set for that element.
        Otherwise, the width of the div will be automatically set to the full
        width of its containing element, like the body
      </p>

      <h2>COLLAPSE</h2>
      <h3></h3>
      <p>
        Horizontal margins (left and right), like padding, are always displayed
        and added together. For example, if two divs with ids #div-one and
        #div-two, are next to each other, they will be as far apart as the sum
        of their adjacent margins.<br />
        It may be helpful to think of collapsing vertical margins as a short
        person trying to push a taller person. The tall person has longer arms
        and can easily push the short person, while the person with short arms
        cannot reach the person with long arms.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="minmax" class="hw">
      <h2>Minimum and Maximum Height and Width</h2>
      <p>
        CSS offers two properties that can limit how narrow or how wide an
        element’s box can be sized to.<br />
        min-width — this property ensures a minimum width of an element’s box.
        <br />max-width — this property ensures a maximum width of an element’s
        box.
        <br />
        the width of all paragraphs will not shrink below 300 pixels, nor will
        the width exceed 600 pixels.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also limit the minimum and maximum height of an element.

        <br />min-height — this property ensures a minimum height for an
        element’s box. <br />max-height — this property ensures a maximum height
        of an element’s box.
        <br />
        the height of all paragraphs will not shrink below 150 pixels and the
        height will not exceed 300 pixels.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="over" class="flow">
      <h1>Overflow</h1>
      <p>
        All of the components of the box model comprise an element’s
        size.Sometimes, these components result in an element that is larger
        than the parent’s containing area. How can we ensure that we can view
        all of an element that is larger than its parent’s containing area?
      </p>
      <p>
        The overflow property controls what happens to content that spills, or
        overflows, outside its box. It can be set to one of the following
        values:<br />

        - hidden - when set to this value, any content that overflows will be
        hidden from view.
        <br />- scroll - when set to this value, a scrollbar will be added to
        the element’s box so that the rest of the content can be viewed by
        scrolling. <br />- visible - when set to this value, the overflow
        content will be displayed outside of the containing element. Note, this
        is the default value.<br />
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="reset" class="reset">
      <h1>RESET</h1>
      <p>
        Resetting Defaults All major web browsers have a default stylesheet they
        use in the absence of an external stylesheet. These default stylesheets
        are known as user agent stylesheets. In this case, the term “user agent“
        is a technical term for the browser. User agent stylesheets often have
        default CSS rules that set default values for padding and margin. This
        affects how the browser displays HTML elements, which can make it
        difficult for a developer to design or style a web page. Many developers
        choose to reset these default values so that they can truly work with a
        clean slate. The code in the example above resets the default margin and
        padding values of all HTML elements. It is often the first CSS rule in
        an external stylesheet. Note that both properties are both set to 0.
        When these properties are set to 0, they do not require a unit of
        measurement.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="visible" class="visible">
      <h1>VISIBILITY</h1>
      <p>
        Elements can be hidden from view with the visibility property. The
        visibility property can be set to one of the following values:
      </p>

      <li>hidden — hides an element.</li>
      <li>visible — displays an element.</li>
      <li class="future">hidden element, momentarly not visible on the page</li>
      <p>
        In the example above, the list item with a class of future will be
        hidden from view in the browser. Keep in mind, however, that users can
        still view the contents of the list item (e.g., Donate) by viewing the
        source code in their browser. Furthermore, the web page will only hide
        the contents of the element. It will still leave an empty space where
        the element is intended to display.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Note: What’s the difference between display: none and visibility:
        hidden? An element with display: none will be completely removed from
        the web page. An element with visibility: hidden, however, will not be
        visible on the web page, but the space reserved for it will.
      </h2>
    </div>

    <div id="review">
      <h1 style="color: black">Review</h1>
      <p style="text-align: left; margin: 0 40px">
        In this lesson, we covered the four properties of the box model: height
        and width, padding, borders, and margins. Understanding the box model is
        an important step towards learning more advanced HTML and CSS topics.
        Let’s take a minute to review what you learned.

        <br />- The box model comprises a set of properties used to create space
        around and between HTML elements. <br />- The height and width of a
        content area can be set in pixels or percentage. <br />- Borders
        surround the content area and padding of an element. The color, style,
        and thickness of a border can be set with CSS properties. <br />-
        Padding is the space between the content area and the border. It can be
        set in pixels or percent. <br />- Margin is the amount of spacing
        outside of an element’s border. <br />- Horizontal margins add, so the
        total space between the borders of adjacent elements is equal to the sum
        of the right margin of one element and the left margin of the adjacent
        element. <br />- Vertical margins collapse, so the space between
        vertically adjacent elements is equal to the larger margin. margin: 0
        auto horizontally centers an element inside of its parent content area,
        if it has a width. <br />- The overflow property can be set to display,
        hide, or scroll, and dictates how HTML will render content that
        overflows its parent’s content area. <br />- The visibility property can
        hide or show elements.
