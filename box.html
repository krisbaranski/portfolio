            <li>Padding - specifies the amount of space between the content area and the border.</li>

    <div id="border" class="border">
        <h1>BORDER</h1>
        <h2>A border is a line that surrounds an element, like a frame around a painting. <br>
            Borders can be set with a specific width, style, and color.</h2>
        <p>
            <li>width — The thickness of the border. A border’s thickness can be set in pixels or with one of the
                following keywords: thin, medium, or thick.
            </li>
            <li>style — The design of the border. Web browsers can render any of 10 different styles. Some of these
                styles include: none, dotted, and solid.</li>
            <li>color — The color of the border. Web browsers can render colors using a few different formats, including
                140 built-in color keywords.</li>
            <li>The default border is medium none color, where color is the current color of the element. <br>
                If width,style, or color are not set in the CSS file, the web browser assigns the default value for that
                property.
            </li>
        </p>

    <div id="radius" class="round">
        <h1>RADIUS</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>RADIUS</li>
            <li>RADIUS</li>
            <li>RADIUS</li>
            <li>RADIUS</li>
            <li>RADIUS</li>
            <li>RADIUS</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can modify the corners of an element’s border box with the border-radius property.<br><br>
            You can create a border that is a perfect circle by first creating an element with the same width and height
            and then setting the radius equal to the distance between the center of the circle and the width of the box,
            which is 50%.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="padding" class="inside">
        <h1>PADDING</h1>
        <h3>The padding property is often used to expand the background color and make content look less cramped.</h3>
        <p>If you want to be more specific about the amount of padding on each side of a box’s content, you can use the
            following properties:
            <br>padding-top
            <br>padding-right
            <br>padding-bottom
            <br>padding-left
            <br>Each property affects the padding on only one side of the box’s content, giving you more flexibility in
            customization.
        </p>
        <h3> PADDING - another implementations</h3>
        <p>the four values 6px 11px 4px 9px correspond to the amount of padding in a clockwise rotation. In order, it
            specifies the amount of padding on the top (6 pixels), right (11 pixels), bottom (4 pixels), and left (9
            pixels) sides of the content.</p>
        <p>When using this implementation of the padding property, we must specify a padding value for all four sides of
            the element.

            However, if the top and bottom values for padding will equal each other, and the left and right values for
            padding will also equal each other, you can use the shortcut:
            The first value, 5px, sets the padding value for the top and bottom sides of the content. The second value,
            10px, sets the padding value for the left and right sides of the content.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="margin" class="margin">
        <h1>MARGIN: VALUES</h1>
        <h2>Margin refers to the space directly outside of the box. <br>The margin property is used to specify the size
            of
            this space.</h2>
        <p>One can use only one property "margin", which will specify all four sides of the margin. If you want to
            be even more specific about the amount of margin on each side of a box, you can use the
            following properties:
            <br>margin-top
            <br>margin-right
            <br>margin-bottom
            <br>margin-left
            <br>Each property affects the margin on only one side of the box, providing more flexibility in
            customization.
            It’s common to see margin values used only for a specific side of an element.
        </p>
        <p>Just like the padding shortcut, when you’re certain that the top and bottom values for margin will equal each
            other, and that the left and right values for margin will also equal each other, you can use the shortcut of
            two values.</p>
        <p>A similar implementation of the margin property is used to specify exactly how much margin there should be on
            each side of the box in a single declaration. Like in the padding of four different values.<br>
            The four values 6px 10px 5px 12px refer to the amount of margin around the box in a clockwise rotation. In
            order, it specifies the amount of margin on the top (6 pixels), right (10 pixels), bottom (5 pixels), and
            left (12 pixels) sides of the box.</p>


    </div>

    <div id="auto" class="collapse">
        <h1>MARGIN: AUTO and COLLAPSE</h1>
        <h2>AUTO</h2>
        <p>In the example above, margin: 0 auto; will center the divs in their containing elements. The 0 sets the top
            and bottom margins to 0 pixels. The auto value instructs the browser to adjust the left and right margins
            until the element is centered within its containing element.<br>
            in the example above should center within an element that fills the page, but this doesn’t occur. Why?<br>
            In order to center an element, a width must be set for that element. Otherwise, the width of the div will be
            automatically set to the full width of its containing element, like the body</p>

        <h2>COLLAPSE</h2>
        <h3></h3>
        <p>Horizontal margins (left and right), like padding, are always displayed and added together. For example, if
            two divs with ids #div-one and #div-two, are next to each other, they will be as far apart as the sum of
            their adjacent margins.<br>
            It may be helpful to think of collapsing vertical margins as a short person trying to push a taller person.
            The tall person has longer arms and can easily push the short person, while the person with short arms
            cannot reach the person with long arms.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="minmax" class="hw">
        <h2>Minimum and Maximum Height and Width</h2>
        <p>CSS offers two properties that can limit how narrow or how wide an element’s box can be sized to.<br>
            min-width — this property ensures a minimum width of an element’s box.
            <br>max-width — this property ensures a maximum width of an element’s box.
            <br>
            the width of all paragraphs will not shrink below 300 pixels, nor will the width exceed 600 pixels.
        </p>
        <p>You can also limit the minimum and maximum height of an element.

            <br>min-height — this property ensures a minimum height for an element’s box.
            <br>max-height — this property ensures a maximum height of an element’s box.
            <br>
            the height of all paragraphs will not shrink below 150 pixels and the height will not exceed 300 pixels.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="over" class="flow">
        <h1>Overflow</h1>
        <p>All of the components of the box model comprise an element’s size.Sometimes, these components result in an
            element that is larger than the parent’s containing area.

            How can we ensure that we can view all of an element that is larger than its parent’s containing area?</p>
        <p>The overflow property controls what happens to content that spills, or overflows, outside its box. It can be
            set to one of the following values:<br>

            - hidden - when set to this value, any content that overflows will be hidden from view.
            <br>- scroll - when set to this value, a scrollbar will be added to the element’s box so that the rest of
            the
            content can be viewed by scrolling.
            <br>- visible - when set to this value, the overflow content will be displayed outside of the containing
            element. Note, this is the default value.<br>
        </p>

    </div>
    <div id="reset" class="reset">
        <h1>RESET</h1>
        <p>Resetting Defaults
            All major web browsers have a default stylesheet they use in the absence of an external stylesheet. These
            default stylesheets are known as user agent stylesheets. In this case, the term “user agent“ is a technical
            term for the browser.

            User agent stylesheets often have default CSS rules that set default values for padding and margin. This
            affects how the browser displays HTML elements, which can make it difficult for a developer to design or
            style a web page.

            Many developers choose to reset these default values so that they can truly work with a clean slate. The
            code in the example above resets the default margin and padding values of all HTML elements. It is often the
            first CSS rule in an external stylesheet.

            Note that both properties are both set to 0. When these properties are set to 0, they do not require a unit
            of measurement.

        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="visible" class="visible">
        <h1>VISIBILITY</h1>
        <p>Elements can be hidden from view with the visibility property.

            The visibility property can be set to one of the following values:</p>

        <li>hidden — hides an element.</li>
        <li>visible — displays an element.</li>
        <li class="future">hidden element, momentarly not visible on the page</li>
        <p>In the example above, the list item with a class of future will be hidden from view in the browser.

            Keep in mind, however, that users can still view the contents of the list item (e.g., Donate) by viewing
            the
            source code in their browser. Furthermore, the web page will only hide the contents of the element. It
            will
            still leave an empty space where the element is intended to display.
        </p>
        <h2>Note: What’s the difference between display: none and visibility: hidden? An element with display: none will
            be completely removed from the web page. An element with visibility: hidden, however, will not be visible on
            the web page, but the space reserved for it will.</h2>
    </div>

    <div id="review">
        <h1 style="color: black;">Review</h1>
        <p style="text-align: left; margin: 0 40px;"> In this lesson, we covered the four properties of the box model:
            height and width,
            padding, borders, and
            margins. Understanding the box model is an important step towards learning more advanced HTML and CSS
            topics. Let’s take a minute to review what you learned.

            <br>- The box model comprises a set of properties used to create space around and between HTML elements.
            <br>- The height and width of a content area can be set in pixels or percentage.
            <br>- Borders surround the content area and padding of an element. The color, style, and thickness of a
            border can
            be set with CSS properties.
            <br>- Padding is the space between the content area and the border. It can be set in pixels or percent.
            <br>- Margin is the amount of spacing outside of an element’s border.
            <br>- Horizontal margins add, so the total space between the borders of adjacent elements is equal to the
            sum of
            the right margin of one element and the left margin of the adjacent element.
            <br>- Vertical margins collapse, so the space between vertically adjacent elements is equal to the larger
            margin.
            margin: 0 auto horizontally centers an element inside of its parent content area, if it has a width.
            <br>- The overflow property can be set to display, hide, or scroll, and dictates how HTML will render
            content that
            overflows its parent’s content area.
            <br>- The visibility property can hide or show elements.
