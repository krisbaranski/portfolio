    <div>
        <p>The box model has an awkward limitation regarding box dimensions. This limitation is best
            illustrated with an example. Unfortunately, under the current box model, the border thickness and the
            padding will affect the dimensions of the box.

            The 10 pixels of padding increases the height of the box to 220 pixels and the width to 320 pixels. Next,
            the 1-pixel thick border increases the height to 222 pixels and the width to 322 pixels. Under this box
            model, the border thickness and padding are added to the overall dimensions of the box. This makes it
            difficult to accurately size a box. Over time, this can also make all of a web page’s content difficult to
            position and manage.

            In this brief lesson, you’ll learn how to use a different technique that avoids this problem altogether.
            In CSS, the box-sizing property controls the type of box model the browser should use when interpreting a
            web page.

            The default value of this property is content-box. This is the same box model that is affected by border
            thickness and padding.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="content" class="content">

        <h1>CONTENT BOX</h1>
        <h2><img src="contentbox.svg"></h2>
    </div>

    <div id="border" class="border">
        <h1>BORDER BOX</h1>
        <p>Fortunately, we can reset the entire box model and specify a new one: border-box.
            The code in the CSS example resets the box model to border-box for all HTML elements. This new box model
            avoids the dimensional issues that exist in the former box model you learned about.

            In this box model, the height and width of the box will remain fixed. The border thickness and padding will
            be included inside of the box, which means the overall dimensions of the box do not change.
        </p>
        <h2><img src="borderbox.svg"></h2>
    </div>

    <div id="review" class="review">
        <h1>Review: Changing the Box Model</h1>
        <p>
            In this lesson, you learned about an important limitation of the default box model: box dimensions are
            affected by border thickness and padding.

            Let’s review what you learned:

            <br>In the default box model, box dimensions are affected by border thickness and padding.
            <br>The box-sizing property controls the box model used by the browser.
            <br>The default value of the box-sizing property is content-box.
            <br>The value for the new box model is border-box.
            <br>The border-box model is not affected by border thickness or padding.
