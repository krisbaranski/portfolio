        The box model has an awkward limitation regarding box dimensions. This
        limitation is best illustrated with an example. Unfortunately, under the
        current box model, the border thickness and the padding will affect the
        dimensions of the box. The 10 pixels of padding increases the height of
        the box to 220 pixels and the width to 320 pixels. Next, the 1-pixel
        thick border increases the height to 222 pixels and the width to 322
        pixels. Under this box model, the border thickness and padding are added
        to the overall dimensions of the box. This makes it difficult to
        accurately size a box. Over time, this can also make all of a web page’s
        content difficult to position and manage. In this brief lesson, you’ll
        learn how to use a different technique that avoids this problem
        altogether. In CSS, the box-sizing property controls the type of box
        model the browser should use when interpreting a web page. The default
        value of this property is content-box. This is the same box model that
        is affected by border thickness and padding.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="content" class="content">
      <h1>CONTENT BOX</h1>
      <h2><img src="contentbox.svg" /></h2>
    </div>

    <div id="border" class="border">
      <h1>BORDER BOX</h1>
      <p>
        Fortunately, we can reset the entire box model and specify a new one:
        border-box. The code in the CSS example resets the box model to
        border-box for all HTML elements. This new box model avoids the
        dimensional issues that exist in the former box model you learned about.
        In this box model, the height and width of the box will remain fixed.
        The border thickness and padding will be included inside of the box,
        which means the overall dimensions of the box do not change.

      <h1>Review: Changing the Box Model</h1>

        In this lesson, you learned about an important limitation of the default
        box model: box dimensions are affected by border thickness and padding.
        Let’s review what you learned:

        <br />In the default box model, box dimensions are affected by border
        thickness and padding. <br />The box-sizing property controls the box
        model used by the browser. <br />The default value of the box-sizing
        property is content-box. <br />The value for the new box model is
        border-box. <br />The border-box model is not affected by border
        thickness or padding.
